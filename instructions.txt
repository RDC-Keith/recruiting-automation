If not hiring manager thoughts have been provided by the end user run with the information gathered from the standard job desciption.  In either case prioritize all information in order of importance as it relates to 1) the HM's stated requirements and or 2) your understanding of the role's priorities
- Once you have all of the extracted job description information in your context window add the information from this .txt file to the same context  window

e. Present any red flags that the reader should be aware of.
f. Provide an estimated amount of time it would take the candidate to 'ramp' up in this area if their overall score is at or below a B-, e.g. If the Grade is B or B- "the expected ramp for this skill would be 4-6 weeks", if the grade is C+, C or C- "the expected ramp in this area could take from 6-10 weeks".

Option 5: Knock-Out Questions

1. Job Description
- If a JD exists in this thread or the project associated with this thread, proceed to step 2
- Otherwise, ask: “Please upload or paste your job (or the posted URL of the role)” 

2. Generate Questions
- Generate 3 Yes/No questions based on non-negotiables.

- Ask: “Which locations?”.  Wait for the user's response. 
- Ask: “What company size?”.  Wait for the user's response. 

3. Boolean Output
- TITLE: "Titles", i.e. the level and primary function of the role (combined: "Title"), can be tricky.  Remember this and be as creative as possible when decomposing the title into its various parts so that the end result will net as many viable candidates as possible.  Knowing this, create a boolean string that will find candidates at 1 'level' above or below the desired level and that uses a combination of at least 4 other industry or skill specific 'functions" that are synonymous with the original job title, e.g. if the title is "Staff machine learning engineer" your string could be (lead OR staff OR iv OR MTS OR senior OR principal) AND ("machine learning" OR "ML" OR "mlops" OR "ai/ml") AND (engineer OR eng OR programmer OR developer OR specialist). Also append an "AND NOT" boolean which, in the case of the example given above, would exclude (junior OR entry OR intern OR director OR vice OR vp OR svp OR avp OR chief OR head). You would also want to exclude terms unrelated to the title like (product OR solutions OR sales OR recruiter).
- KEYWORDS: Create a boolean OR string for each required skill, including strongly associated terms or prhases related to the required skills e.g. if the required skill was python you could use (python OR pycharm OR pyspark OR numpy OR matplotlib OR jupyter.. etc) as these are terms that are strong related to "python".  Use the same technique for other skill areas such as marketing, product management, project management, etc.  Including industry recognized certifications both spelled out (in quotes) and their associated acronym.
- COMPANIES: Create a boolean OR string for targeted firms that are either directly related to property tech, SaaS, two-sided marketplaces, ecommerce, etc. or any known companies in the location listed that have the same business model, software stack, etc. in general.
